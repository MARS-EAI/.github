##  MARS-EAI: Building Real-World Embodied Society with Agents

---

English | 英文

🌟 **Hello, Embodied Intelligence Explorers!** Welcome to the MARS-EAI（Mult- Agent Robotic System) Community, a multi-agent embodied intelligence community. The core motivation of MARS is to advance multi-embodied agents from "digital collaboration" to "physical integration." By focusing on cross-level coordination, compositional constraint modeling, and human-machine hybrid intelligence, MARS aims to establish the foundation of collective intelligence in the physical world for AGI.

📘 **Our Mission:** We provide a comprehensive research platform for embodied agents, offering perception, reasoning, and decision-making frameworks for multi-embodied agents, along with automated scene generation and data production processes to promote the development of multi-agent and embodied intelligence communities. Our fundamental research follows the principle of **Compositional Constraints**, ensuring decisions adhere to logical, temporal, and spatial limitations, thereby building high-performance, safe, and trustworthy multi-agent embodied systems.

🙌 **Join Us:** Whether you are a beginner in embodied intelligence or a pioneering researcher exploring the fields of embodied intelligence and multi-agent systems, we warmly welcome you to join the MARS community. Connect with like-minded peers and work together to build intelligent collaborative systems for embodied agents.

🌟 **你好，具身智能探索者们！**
这里是MARS-EAI社区，一个多智能体具身智能社区。MARS的核心出发点在于推动多具身智能体从“数字协作”迈向“物理共融”，通过跨层级协同、组合约束建模、人机混合智能等方向，为AGI提供物理世界的群体智能基础。

📘 **我们的目标：**
我们提供一个全面的具身智能体科研平台，提供多具身智能体的感知，推理和决策框架，并附带自动化场景生成和数据生产流程，促进多智能体和具身社区的发展。我们的基础研究遵循 **组合约束**，即决策符合逻辑，时间，空间上的限定条件，构建高性能、安全可信的多智能体具身系统。

🙌 **加入我们：**
无论你是具身智能初学者，还是正在具身智能和多智能体领域探索的科研先锋，我们都欢迎大家加入MARS社区与志同道合的伙伴一起交流并构建智能化的具身智能体协作系统。
